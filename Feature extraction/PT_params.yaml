# Extracting features from NSCLC patients
setting:
  # Image discretization:
  # The ideal number of bins is somewhere in the order of 16-128 bins. A possible way to define a good binwidt is to
  # extract firstorder:Range from the dataset to analyze, and choose a binwidth so, that range/binwidth remains approximately
  # in this range of bins.
  binWidth: 0.1
 # binCount: 64
  label: 1
  # Normalization:
  # MR signal is usually relative, with large differences between scanners and vendors. By normalizing the image before
  # feature calculation, this confounding effect may be reduced. However, if only one specific scanner is used, or the
  # images reflect some absolute world value (e.g. ADC maps, T2maps (NOT T2 weighted)), consider disabling the
  # normalization.
#  normalize: true
#  normalizeScale: 100  # This allows you to use more or less the same bin width.

  interpolator: 'sitkLinear' # This is an enumerated value, here None is not allowed
  resampledPixelSpacing: [2,2,2] # This disables resampling, as it is interpreted as None, to enable it, specify spacing in x, y, z as [x, y , z]
  resegmentRange: [0,1000000]

  # Mask validation:
  # correctMask and geometryTolerance are not needed, as both image and mask are resampled, if you expect very small
  # masks, consider to enable a size constraint by uncommenting settings below:
  minimumROIDimensions: 2
  minimumROISize: 64

# Image types to use: "Original" for unfiltered image, for possible filters, see documentation.

# Featureclasses, from which features must be calculated. If a featureclass is not mentioned, no features are calculated
# for that class. Otherwise, the specified features are calculated, or, if none are specified, all are calculated (excluding redundant/deprecated features).
featureClass:
  # redundant Compactness 1, Compactness 2 an Spherical Disproportion features are disabled by default, they can be
  # enabled by specifying individual feature names (as is done for glcm) and including them in the list.
  shape:
  firstorder:  # specifying an empty list has the same effect as specifying nothing.
  glcm:  # Disable SumAverage by specifying all other GLCM features available
  glrlm: # for lists none values are allowed, in this case, all features are enabled
  glszm:
  gldm:  # contains deprecated features, but as no individual features are specified, the deprecated features are not enabled
